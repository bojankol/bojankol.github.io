I am a principal research engineer developing machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches, delivering solutions for problems in cybersecurity, and making AI secure and trustworthy. My scientific research skills have been refined from working at highly regarded research institutions, such as DLR, Fraunhofer AISEC, and the Technical University of Munich. In my current position as a Principal Engineer in AI at HSBC I am working on the development and applications of machine learning techniques to improve automation and increase efficiency, primarily in cybersecurity processes, by leveraging large-scale heterogeneous data. I am collaborating with cybersecurity operations teams in creating advanced analytics capabilities that improve the detection of anomalous activity and threats to the organization.
